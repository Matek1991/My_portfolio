  <meta name="description" content="I am a student at Edinburgh College, currently studying HND Web Development. 
  Next year, I will continue my education at Edinburgh Napier University. 
  During my time at college, I have worked on many projects, including building websites, designing user interfaces, and writing professional documentation. 
  I have learned how to create websites that look good and work well on different devices. 
  I have also used different programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. These projects helped me understand both the design and technical side of web development. 
  I have also learned about databases, teamwork, and how to manage projects using simple tools and methods. 
  This portfolio shows the work my skills, which I have developed during my studies. 
  I am excited to keep learning at university and to start my future career in web development or design.
  This is an index page present general information about my projects, which I have done throughout my studies and about myself.">
