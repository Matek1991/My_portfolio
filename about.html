  <h1 class="about-heading">About me</h1>
  <p class="about_me">I'm 33 years old and have been studying web development for the past two years, starting from
    level
    5. Next year, I'm excited to begin my HND level studies, and I'm looking forward to it. <br>
    Over the last two years,
    I've completed several exciting projects, which have given me valuable experience and confidence in my abilities.
    <br>
    My hobbies and interests are wide-ranging, but I have a particular passion for programming and music. I enjoy diving
    deep into coding challenges and expressing myself through music. I'm enthusiastic about learning and growing in both
    of these areas, and I'm eager to see where my journey takes me.
